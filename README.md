# Wearable Computing / Peer Assessments / Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Peer Assessment 1 - Getting and Cleaning Data 

( https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata ) - 

Coursera Data Science Specialization Track 

> One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

## Scripts and Resulting Data

* The script to generate the tidy data is [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/thatcher/GetData_PeerAssessment1/blob/master/run_analysis.R)
* The resulting tidy data set is [tidy_final.txt](https://github.com/thatcher/GetData_PeerAssessment1/blob/master/tidy_final.txt)
* The codebook describing the resulting data set is [CodeBook.md](https://github.com/thatcher/GetData_PeerAssessment1/blob/master/CodeBook.md) which can be regenerated with knitr on [CodeBook.Rmd](https://github.com/thatcher/GetData_PeerAssessment1/blob/master/CodeBook.Rmd).
